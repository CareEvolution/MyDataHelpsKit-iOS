# MyDataHelpsKit examples

A SwiftUI app demonstrating usage of MyDataHelpsKit. For more information about the MyDataHelpsKit SDK, see the main [readme file](https://github.com/CareEvolution/MyDataHelpsKit-iOS).

To get started, open `MyDataHelpsKit-Example.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the app. Once the app launches, you will need to enter a valid participant token to authenticate and use the app's functionality. See [documentation on Participant Tokens](https://developer.rkstudio.careevolution.com/sdk/participant_tokens.html) for more information about obtaining an access token.
